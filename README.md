# Intermediate C++: Unions

A union combines multiple types into one object.
They can be declared and used similarly to structs, but unlike a struct, every member of a union will share the same memory.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
